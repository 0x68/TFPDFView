# PDF Viewer using mozillapdfjs as submodule

- This is a early beta with a stupid working example
- Render PDF Files from binary Data and URL works but some issues are remaing.
- Feel free to contribute and improve this Project


- In PDFViewController.j you should fix the path to the PDF File, will be fixed in next releases.
